-- How can you output a list of all members, 
-- including the individual who recommended them (if any), 
-- without using any joins? Ensure that there are no duplicates in the list, 
-- and that each firstname + surname pairing is formatted as a column and ordered.

-- How can you produce a list of bookings on the day of 2012-09-14 
-- which will cost the member (or guest) more than $30? Remember that guests 
-- have different costs to members (the listed costs are per half-hour 'slot'), 
-- and the guest user is always ID 0. Include in your output the name of the facility, 
-- the name of the member formatted as a single column, and the cost. Order by descending cost, 
-- and do not use any subqueries.
